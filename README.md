# Requirement

Python 3.5

# Fork

This has been forked from: https://github.com/Megachell/mysql-to-postgres  
to git@github.com:networkinss/mysql-to-postgres.git  
I need a python script which I can integrate into other projects.   
And I need to have the output in a file (and not executed).  
Some adjustments and additions are needed as well.
